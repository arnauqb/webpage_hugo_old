# [Elbowpatched Boilerplate](http://elbowpatched.com)

Elbowpatched Boilerplate is a template to make it easier to create an academic personal website.
It is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.
Since this template is built on Jekyll, 
you can publish your website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for free.

## Why?

As a scholar, having an academic personal website can be a good way for you to publicize your research.
Your website can have descriptions of your research projects, 
a list of your published papers, 
and links to your slides and video presentations.

However, creating an academic personal website takes a lot of time.
Time that you also have to spend reading papers, conducting studies, analyzing data, and writing papers.

Elbowpatched Boilerplate is here to help!
It has the following features that make it easier to create an academic personal website.

* Fill out simple files with information about yourself, your publications, projects, and presentations.
* Use the provided templates or create your own to change the presentation of your content.
* Publish your website on GitHub Pages for free.


## Quick start

* Clone the git repo - `git clone https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate.git`.
* Setup and run [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
* Edit the contents of the [YAML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) files in the folder `_data`.
  * `personal.yml` - Your personal information
  * `publications.yml` - Bibliography of your publications
  * `projects.yml` - Descriptions of your projects with pictures
  * `presentations.yml` - Your presentations with links to slides
* Preview your website at `index.html`


## Layouts

Elbowpatched Boilerplate currently only has one template that you can use: 
[Albertine](https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate/blob/gh-pages/_layouts/albertine.html).
Feel free to modify it to your needs.
I will add more layouts as this project progresses.

If you want to create a new template, take a look at 
[Albertine](https://github.com/ianli/elbowpatched-boilerplate/blob/gh-pages/_layouts/albertine.html) 
for inspiration. 
The [Templates documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) on the Jekyll site and
[Liquid Basics](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics) 
are good introductions to Liquid, the template language of Jekyll.

1. Publish on GitHub Pages - [instructions](https://pages.github.com/).
