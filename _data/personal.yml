intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >

    I'm a PhD student at [Durham](http://www.icc.dur.ac.uk/).
    Before Durham, I did a Masters in Physics at the [University of Heidelberg](http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/), and a double bachelors degree in Physics and Mathematics at the [University of Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/), where I am from.
    I am currently supervised by

    [Cedric Lacey](https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?id=1875),
    [Chris Done](https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?username=dph0cd), and
    [Richard Bower](https://www.dur.ac.uk/physics/staff/profiles/?id=527)

    I am currently working on improving the way black holes are modelled in big cosmological simulations. For that end, I am working on a Python code that is capable of calculating how much mass is lifted from a black hole accretion disc in the form of a wind. You can follow the status of the project in my GitHub account [Qwind](https://www.github.com/arnauqb/qwind), and in upcoming scientific articles.

    I have also worked on weak gravitational lensing, especifically on computing the bias to cosmological parameter inference due to second order general relativistic effects on light propagation -> [Paper](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/477/1/741/4935187).

    Despite my love for Physics and Astronomy, I also have a passion for everything involving a computer and a terminal. During my PhD, I have done two industrial placements at [Ibex Innovations](http://ibexinnovations.co.uk/), and at the digital aviation lab of Boeing in Frankfurt. In both of the placements I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge in computer vision in medical imaging and aviation.
